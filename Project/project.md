## ACCY 571 Group Project

## Prompt

Your boss at Goliath National Bank sends you the frustratingly vague directive "We're interested funding some new restaurants/coffee shops/bars/etc. in the far off land of ____ but we need your team to 'get a better picture of the consumers' before we get make any moves".  

Your task is to pick a region or city and use the provided yelp database to characterize the eating/spending habits of consumers there. Your boss doesn't specify what she's looking for so its up to you best figure out how to do this.

Some ideas to consider are:

- What types of restaurants are most popular?  Can we predict the rating of different types of restaurants? How does your city compare to other major cities or nearby towns? I.e. do coffee shops fair better in Champaign than elsewhere?
- What can be learned from the review text itself? Whats the sentiment towards different types of eateries? What are reviewers talking about the most?
- Do users who visit one business tend to visit certain other businesses? I.e. do people who like seven saints tend to like distihl? What about their friends?
- Is the restaurant selection diverse or homogeonous? Are there a lot of a few types of restaurants? Has this been changing over time? Is there a demand for more types of food?
- How much does location matter? Are there central hubs where restaurants tend to do well in the reviews?

These ideas are __not__ meant to be comprehensive. You should try to answer 3 major questions, one of which your group comes up with on their own (i.e. not on this list).

## Objectives

#### Exposition

1. Break the overarching question 'What are consumer's eating habits' into at least 3 smaller sub-questions. 
2. Explain how answering these contributes to answering the overarching question.

#### Pull and Process Data

1. Use the yelp database to construct datasets to be used in your analysis.
2. Create features, preprocess, normalize, cluster, reduce dimensions, etc as necessary.

#### Analysis

1. Question 1
   1. Use graphs, machine learning, data aggregation, or anything else needed to answer the question
2. Question 2
   1. Use graphs, machine learning, data aggregation, or anything else needed to answer the question
3. Question 3
   1. Use graphs, machine learning, data aggregation, or anything else needed to answer the question

#### Conclusion

Summarize your results, in plain english, as if this is the only part your boss will read. Note your boss is intelligent but has no interest in code or model output, she is only interested in words, pictures, and metrics.

## Notes

- Completeing the objectives will most likely __NOT__ proceed linearly. Analysis and data pulling will influence each other and each of these will influence the types of questions you can ask/answer.
