#### Overall - 50 Points

1. __Cohesiveness - 25 Points__
   1. The report comes together a singular focused narrartive detailing the end to end modeling process including major data and methodological decisions, signficicant findings, and interpretation of numerical results. 
2. __Style - 25 Points__
   1. The report is free any extraneous and unexplained analysis, code, model output, and plots. All commentary is done in Markdown cells using grammatically correct English. Plots are of a consistent size and style.
