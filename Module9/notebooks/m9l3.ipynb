    "## Introduction to Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we introduce Markov chains, a simple technique to model systems that change state with well-define probabilities. Specifically, a Markov chain is memoryless, which means the transition is independent of previous steps. A Markov chain model can be used to predict the state of a system under uncertainty, and forms the basis for more powerful modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models, that extend this approach to individual components within the overall system.\n",
