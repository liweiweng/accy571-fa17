    "##  Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a technique to generate samples from (potentially) complex distributions. Monte Carlo techniques have been used for many years to numerically evaluate a function by using random sampling (e.g., numerical integration). Markov chain Monte Carlo extends these ideas to use a Markov chain to sample from a distribution that we wish to numerically evaluate, and we use Monte Carlo to perform the numerical evaluation. \n",
