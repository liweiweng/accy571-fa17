    "# Module 9: Introduction to Probabilistic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This module introduces basic concepts in probabilistic analysis. First, we learn how quantifying uncertainty can improve the decision making process, which can lead to strategic advantages. Second, we introduce Bayesian statistics, which provides a natural framework to include uncertainty when statistically modeling a system. Third, we introduce Markov chains, which can be used to evaluate a system that transitions between states in a memoryless manner. Finally, we introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo, which is a technique for numerically evaluating functions, such as integrals of probability distributions.\n",
