    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "To do well in this course, remember the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log in frequently to manage your messages on a near-daily basis. If you let them pile up for 3 to 4 days, you might be overwhelmed. You should start working on new weekly content right away, on Monday of each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stay on top of the course work. Falling behind will make it harder to catch up, and even harder to understand new concepts that build on previous lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we'll all learn better.\n",
