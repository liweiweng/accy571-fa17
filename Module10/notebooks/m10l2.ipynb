    "In this lesson, you will about Bayesian Modeling, in which we apply Bayes rule to compute the likelihood of a model fitting a particular data set. In this approach, we encapsulate our prior knowledge of model parameters, and use the observed data to compute the likelihood of the model. By sampling from this likelihood we can compute posterior distributions for our model parameters, which allows us to fully specify the best fitting model to our data. This sampling process uses a technique known as Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). To perform Bayesian modeling, we will use the PyMC3 library.\n",
