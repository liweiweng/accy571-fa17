    "Most analytic scripts or programs that we have developed have been deterministic, meaning every time the code runs the same process is repeated generating the same answer. The real world, however, is filled with uncertainty. Will it rain today? How bad will the the traffic be on my commute? How many emails will I have to respond to today? How will our sales change over the next quarter? To develop analytic scripts that can handle uncertainty, we must switch to a new programming paradigm that models the process of interest and performs inference to determine the best model parameters. While more complicated than the traditional approach, this new paradigm generates both answers as well as a quantification of the uncertainty on those answers. To perform probabilistic programming in Python we will use the PyMC3 library.\n",
