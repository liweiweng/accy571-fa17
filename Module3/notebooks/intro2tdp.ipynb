    "Since a Python _string_ is a standard data structure, the standard [Python sequence operators][pso] can be used to quickly perform basic text data processing.  Given a value `v`, integer `n`, and similar typed sequences `s` and `t`:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Description |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| `v in s`| `True` if `v` is in the sequence `s`, otherwise `False`|\n",
    "| `v not in s`| `False` if `v` is in the sequence `s`, otherwise `True`|\n",
    "| `s + t`| concatenation of `s` and `t`|\n",
    "| `s * n` or `n* s`| `n` shallow copies of `s` concatenated|\n",
    "| `len(s)`| the number of elements in the sequence `s`|\n",
    "| `min(s)`| the smallest elements in the sequence `s`|\n",
    "| `max(s)`| the largest of elements in the sequence `s`|\n",
    "| `s.count(v)`| number of times `v` appears in `s`|\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Code cells, we demonstrate the use of most of these operators on our email message. First, we count and display the number of characters in the message via the `len` function. Next, we test if a character sequence `Brunner` is in the message, which returns `True`. Third, we count and display the number of times a sequence of characters (`ou`) appears in the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we find and display the maximum and minimum characters in the message. Note, the value of a character derives from its [Unicode][pu] numerical value. One other thing the second Code cell demonstrates is the conversion of the value `max(msg)` via the special format code `!r`. This converts the result into its native representation, which is Unicode string, which allows the Unicode to be displayed instead of processed directly (we would not see the result otherwise).\n",

    "## Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, or RE or regexes, are expressions that can be used to match one or more occurrences of a particular pattern. Regular expressions are not unique to Python, they are used in many programming languages and many Unix command line tools like sed, grep, or awk. [Regular expressions][re] are used in Python through the `re` module. To build a regular expression, you need to understand the syntax of the RE language. Once a regular expression is developed, it is compiled and executed by an engine written in C in order to provide fast execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, most characters in a regular expression simply match themselves, For example `python` would match any occurrence of the six letters `python` either alone or embedded in another word. There are several special characters, known as metacharacters, that control the behavior of the rest of the regular expression. These metacharacters are listed in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metacharacter | Meaning | Example |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| . |  Matches any character except a newline | `1.3` matches `123`, `1a3`, and `1#3` among others |\n",
    "| ^ | Matches sequence at the beginning of the line| `^Python` matches `Python` at the beginning of a line |\n",
    "| $ | Matches sequence at the end of the line | `Python$` matches `Python` at the end of a line |\n",
    "| * | Matches zero or more occurrences of a pattern | `12*3` matches `13`, `123`, `1223`, etc. |\n",
    "| + |  Matches one or more occurrences of a pattern | `12+3` matches `123`, `1223`, etc. |\n",
    "| ? |  Matches zero or one occurrences of a pattern | `12?3` matches `13` and `123` |\n",
    "| { }| Match repeated qualifier | `{m, n}` means match at least `m` and at most `n` occurrences | \n",
    "| [ ] | Used to specify a character class | `[a-z]` means match any lower case character |\n",
    "| \\ | Escape character | `\\w` means match an alphanumeric character, `\\d` means match numerical character, `\\s` means match any whitespace character, and `\\\\` means match a backslash |\n",
    "| &#124; | or operator | `A ` &#124; ` B` match either `A` or `B` |\n",
    "| ( ) | Grouping Operator | (a, b) |\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional point to remember is that inside a character class (i.e., `[ ]`) many of these metacharacters lose their special meaning, and thus can be used to match themselves. For example, inside a character class, the `^` character means _not_, so `[^\\w]` means match any non-alphanumeric character.\n",
    "\n",
    "To master regular expressions requires a lot of practice, but the investment is well worth it as they are used in many different contexts and can greatly simplify otherwise complex tasks. Given a regular expression, there are several functions that can be used to process text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compile`: compiles a regular expression for faster evaluation.\n",
    "- `search`: find regular expression in string\n",
    "- `match`: find regular expression at start of string\n",
    "- `split`: splits the string by matches of a regular expression.\n",
    "- `sub`: replaces substrings that match a regular expression with different string\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Code cells, we repeat several of our previous string processing examples, by using regular expressions to find text sequences, transform text sequences, and to find most common tokens (note the result is slightly different to the order in which the regular expression finds matches).\n",
