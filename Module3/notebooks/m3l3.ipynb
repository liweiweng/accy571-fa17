    "In this lesson, you will learn how to extract information from structured data sets. This includes parsing data from XML formats such as HTML, which is the language in which many web pages are written and stored. To do this you will learn about the BeautifulSoup parsing library and the libxml parsing engine. To demonstrate these concepts, we use them to perform web-scraping, where data is extracted from Internet-accessible webpages.\n",
