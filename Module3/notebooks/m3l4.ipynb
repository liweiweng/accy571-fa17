    "In this lesson, you will complete a worked example that demonstrates how to work with different data sets to make an interesting data visualization known as a _choropleth_. To do this we need to access web resources, parse an XML-based data format, extract meaningful data from a second web accessible resource, and combine it all into a new and interesting visualization.\n",
