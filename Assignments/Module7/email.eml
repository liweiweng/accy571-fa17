Hey big-O, it's ya girl Hillary C.

I'm out here on the campaign trail, trying to get these kids to pokemon-go-to-the-polls and you'll never guess what just happened.

I saw that old boy Bernie Sanders trying to lift at the gym and he is a total LOSER! He couldn't even bench 1 plate! No wonder he couldn't beat me in the primaries. 

Anyways, i'll catch ya after the election. Keep the oval office warm for me.

XOXO gossip girl.
