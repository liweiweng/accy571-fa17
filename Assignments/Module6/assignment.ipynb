    "Write a function called $\\texttt{get_path_similarity}$ that takes in two words and calculates their path similarity using the wordnet corpus. Note that the wordnet corpus has been imported above as $\\texttt{wn}$. Recall also that words passed to wordnet have an ending indicated their part of speech. In this case, we will use words that are marked with $\\texttt{.n.01}$ See the lesson notebook."
