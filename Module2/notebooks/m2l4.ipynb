    "## Python Database Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to work with a SQL based database by using a Python program. This will include using the SQLite database module from within a Python program to connect to a database, execute queries, and process the results. We also will use the Pandas Python library to understand how using a DataFrame can simplify many database programming tasks. In general, Pandas hides many of the database interaction mechanisms to allow one to easily query, update, or insert new data into an existing database. \n",
