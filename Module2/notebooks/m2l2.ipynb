    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to create and delete database and database schema. First, you will earn about basic SQL Syntax, including the allowed SQL data types. While this will focus on the Sqlite3 syntax and data types,  more general information will be conveyed. Next, you will learn how to create and delete databases. Next you will learn how to create database schema, including relational tables, and the columns that define the characteristics of those tables. This will also include a discussion of views, indices, and user defined functions. Finally, you will learn how to drop and alter existing tables.\n",
