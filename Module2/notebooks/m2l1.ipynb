    "##  Introduction to Data Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will start learning about data persistence techniques by using Python. First, you will review using basic file I/O to save Python data. Next, you will learn about Pickling, a Python technique for saving and restoring data by using a custom Python format. Third, you will learn about relational databases, including the basic relational database concepts such as database roles and the ACID test. Finally you will learn about the SQLite database that we will use to demonstrate relational database concept in this course.\n",
