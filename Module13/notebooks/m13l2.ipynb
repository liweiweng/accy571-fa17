    "## Classical Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will introduce the most common classical hypothesis testing techniques, including the t-test and ANOVA with examples in Python to demonstrate how they can be used to infer statistical constraints from samples of data..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to \n",
    "\n",
    "- apply the one sample t-test to constrain the population mean,\n",
    "- explain the utility of the Wicoxon signed rank sum test,\n",
    "- describe the difference between the paired and unpaired t-tests,\n",
    "- articulate the basic concepts behind ANOVA and explain how it can be applied to compare different groups of data, and\n",
    "- apply false discovery rate to reduce the number of false positives in a hypothesis test.\n",
