    "## Resampling and Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson focuses on the application of resampling for a number of classical hypothesis tests including the computation of a population mean, the comparison between samples means, the chi-squared test, and ANOVA.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to \n",
    "\n",
    "- apply resampling by using Python to estimate the mean of a parent population from observed data,\n",
    "- apply resampling by using Python to compare the mean values of two different samples, and\n",
    "- apply resampling by using Python to compute a measure the similarity between different samples.\n",

    "### Time Estimate\n",
