    "# Module 13: Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical statistics provides a number of tests that can be used to infer insights about an unseen population from observed samples. Traditionally, these tests were developed in an age when both the data sets and available computational power were limited. Many of these tests also assume a specific distribution for the parent population, such as the Normal distribution, which introduces a limitation to the efficacy of these methods. In this lesson, we first introduce classical hypothesis testing before introducing an alternative, distribution-free approach to computing these tests that involves resampling.\n",

    "- describe classical hypothesis tests such as the t-test and ANOVA,\n",
    "- apply classical hypothesis tests by using Python to make statistical inferences about populations,\n",
    "- explain how resampling can be used in place of many hypothesis tests, and\n",
