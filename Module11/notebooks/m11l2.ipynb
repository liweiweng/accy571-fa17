    "## Working with Times and Dates \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to work with time and dates within a Python program. While seemingly simple, times and dates have a number of nuances that can complicate using them within a program. The Python language provides a complete interface to working with times and dates from around he world in a simple and effective manner.\n",

    "- describe how computers track and report time,\n",
    "- understand the importance of a common epoch and time deltas,\n",
    "- the formal process by which time zones are handled, and\n",
