    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will be introduced to recommendation systems. Anyone who has used Internet sites for shopping has been exposed to a recommendation system. For example, when you shop at Amazon, you will be given recommendations for items that are often bought together and also items that are similar to the current item of interest. The former is an example of user-based collaborative filtering, where the results from other similar users are summarized to make recommendations/ The latter is an example of item-based collaborative filtering, where other similar items are summarized to make recommendations. Recommendation systems are often easy to understand conceptually, since they can be develop from simple association rules (i.e., A goes with B) and have been frequently used with success by both traditional brick-n-mortar shops and online sites.\n",
