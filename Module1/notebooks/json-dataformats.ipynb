    "When we first discussed reading and writing data from a Python program, we introduced the concept of a file format. In addition, the introduction to text format notebook demonstrated basic text format files. In this notebook, we extend that concept to another text-based file format, the JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, format. Specifically, we will introduce the basic concepts behind JSON format files, and demonstrate how to read and write data in this format by using standard, built-in Python tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "[JavaScript Object Notation][json], or JSON, is a text-based data interchange format that is easy to read and write both for humans and programs. JSON is a [standard][st], published by the [ECMA International][ecma] standard organization, which was originally known as the European Computer Manufacturers Association, but is now a more global organization for the development of global computer and electronic standards. JSON is language independent but uses a syntax that is familiar to anyone who knows a C-based language, like Python. JSON is built on two types of constructs: a dictionary and a list, and the standard dictates how data are mapped into these constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON standard is fairly simple, as it defines an object, an array, a value, a string, and a number data formats, upon which most of the rest of the standard is based. This makes writing and reading JSON data formats fairly straightforward. In Python, this functionality is provided by the built-in [`json`][jspy] module, which simplifies the process of [reading or writing][jsd] Python data structures _serialize_ a data hierarchy into a string representation via the `dump` method, and can _deserialize_ via the `load` module. These processes are demonstrated in the next few code cells.\n",
