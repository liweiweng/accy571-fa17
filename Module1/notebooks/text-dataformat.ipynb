    "format actually comes in two varieties: fixed-width format, and\n",
    "delimiter separated value format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-width format files are preferred by some programming languages, for\n",
    "example, Fortran, and also are easy to view when displayed. But they can\n",
    "be non-trivial to decode in C-based programming languages, including\n",
    "Python. To demonstrate a fixed width format, we can write and\n",
    "subsequently read the airport data we extracted from the SQLite3\n",
    "database. To write this data as a fixed width data format, we first need\n",
    "to construct appropriate [string formatting codes][sfc]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, we construct two format code strings, the\n",
    "first one is for the header row that contains the column labels, while\n",
    "the second one is for the data rows. These format codes are fairly easy\n",
    "to understand, we first enclose each string substitution in curly braces\n",
    "`{ }`, and use numbers to indicate the order of substitution. Next, we\n",
    "provide a colon `:` character to indicate the presence of a formatting\n",
    "code, which consists of numbers and a letter code. The numbers following\n",
    "the colon indicate the field width (in characters) and for\n",
    "floating-point data, the numbers after the period specify the precision\n",
    "(or numbers after the decimal point) of the value. The character code\n",
    "indicates the type of data to encode: 's' for string, and 'f' for\n",
    "floating-point. Thus, for example, `{1:29s}` means first format code\n",
