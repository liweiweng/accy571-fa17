But one of the most important tasks when starting a data analysis project is understanding the format of a data file and how to best extract the necessary information from the data, whatever the format. Furthermore, problems can often arise when performing this task, thus a solid understanding of these concepts is necessary in order to minimize subsequent challenges.

    "## Fixed-Width Format Text\n",
    "\n",
    "The first data format we will discuss are formatted text files. These types of files are seemingly ubiquitous, despite (or perhaps because of) relying on a predominantly ASCII character encoding. This type of data format actually comes in two varieties: fixed-width format, and delimiter separated value format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-width format files are preferred by some programming languages, for example, Fortran, and also are easy to view when displayed. But they can be non-trivial to decode in C-based programming languages, including Python. To demonstrate a fixed width format, we can write and subsequently read the airport data we downloaded earlier from the _stat-computing_ website. To write this data as a fixed width data format, we first need to construct appropriate [string formatting codes][sfc].  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, we construct two format code strings, the first one is for the header row that contains the column labels, while the second one is for the data rows. These format codes are fairly easy to understand, we first enclose each string substitution in curly braces `{ }`, and use numbers to indicate the order of substitution. Next, we provide a colon `:` character to indicate the presence of a formatting code, which consists of numbers and a letter code. The numbers following the colon indicate the field width (in characters) and for floating-point data, the numbers after the period specify the precision (or numbers after the decimal point) of the value. The character code indicates the type of data to encode: 's' for string, and 'f' for floating-point. Thus, for example, `{1:29s}` means first format code substitution, with a representation that is 29 characters wide that will accept a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, we could also use Python's [f-string][pfs] capability, which uses the same format strings to generate a fixed-width format file. In this case, we would simply indicate the variable directly within the curly braces. Thus, rather than `{0:5s}` we have `{row[0]:5s}`. While the f-string approach removes ambiguity and is generally easier to read, the following Code cell uses the first approach, since it results in smaller code for this particular example.\n",

As demonstrated by the previous example, if you know the field widths ahead of time the challenge is greatly simplified.

In this case a good approach is to print out the numerical column values above a few rows of data to simplify determining the widths of each field. This is demonstrated in the following code cell.
