But one of the most important tasks when starting a data analysis project is understanding the format of a data file and how to best extract the necessary information from the data, whatever the format. In this notebook, we explore the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) data format, and present how to read and write data in this format by using standard, built-in Python tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Extensible Markup Language][xml], or XML, is a simple, self-describing text-based data format. XML is a standard developed by the W3C, or World-Wide Web Consortium, originally for large scale publishing, but with the growth of the web it has taken on new roles. XML is based on the concept of element, that can have attributes and values. Elements can be nested, which can indicate parent-child relationships or a form of containerization. While you may never deal directly with XML files, you will interact with other data formats that are based on XML, such as the latest version of HyperTextMarkup Language (HTML5) or the Scalable Vector Graphics format (SVG).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its structured format, you don't simply read an XML document, you must parse the document to build up a model of the elements and their relationships. The [`ElementTree`][xmlpy] parsing model is implemented within the standard Python distribution in the `xml` library. To write an XML file, we simply need to create an instance of this, for example by passing a string into the class constructor, and then writing this XML encoded data to a file. One caveat with this entire process, however, is that the following five characters: `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `\"` are used by the actual markup language, they must be replaced by their corresponding _entity code_. For these five characters, that can be easily done by using the `html.escape` method as shown in the following code cell.\n",

    "As the XML document contents demonstrate above, the XML format can be quite verbose. However, the document's contents are clearly visible and are easily understood. This enables an XML document to be [parsed][ps] based on a rough knowledge of the document. First we need to create and `ElementTree` object and parse the contents of the document, which we can do with the `parse` method and passing in the name of our XML document file. \n",
    "\n",
    "When parsing an XML document, we have a tree model for the XML elements contained in the document. The base of this model is the _root_ element, which is returned by the `parse` method. While there are a number of methods that can be used to find or iterate through elements in the document, in our case we simply want to process each `airport` element; thus we use the `findall` method to find all `airport` elements. The child elements of each `airport` element can be accessed like a Python `list`. The text within an element is accessed by requesting the `text` attribute for that element, while an element attribute is accessed like a `dictionary` where the name of the attribute acts as the _key_ to request a particular _value_. These techniques are demonstrated in the next code cell, where we read in our new XML document, and extract the airport information.\n",
