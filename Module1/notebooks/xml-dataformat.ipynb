    "World-Wide Web Consortium, originally for large scale publishing, but\n",
    "with the growth of the web it has taken on new roles. XML is based on\n",
    "the concept of element, that can have attributes and values. Elements\n",
    "can be nested, which can indicate parent-child relationships or a form of\n",
    "containerization. While you may not ever deal directly with XML files,\n",
    "you wil interact with other data formats that are based on XML, such as\n",

    "Vector Graphics format (SVG).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its structured format, you don't simply read an XML document, you\n",
    "must parse the document to build up a model of the elements and their\n",

    "within the standard Python distribution in the `xml` library. T0 write\n",
    "an XML file, we simply need to create an instance of this, for example\n",
    "by passing a string into the class constructor, and then writing this\n",
    "XML encoded data to a file. One caveat with this entire process,\n",
    "however, is that the following five characters: `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and\n",
